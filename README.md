# Task 7 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Objective
Use SVMs for binary classification using both linear and non-linear kernels.

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn

## Tools Used
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Steps
1. Loaded and visualized 2D features.
2. Trained SVM with linear and RBF kernels.
3. Visualized decision boundaries.
4. Tuned hyperparameters (C, gamma) using GridSearchCV.
5. Evaluated model using 5-fold cross-validation.

## Results
- Best parameters from GridSearch: `C=1`, `gamma=scale`
- Accuracy: ~97% with RBF kernel
